# Media-Services
Have you had to fix something lately?  Did you read instructions, or did you watch a video?  Customers expect the richness of audio and video as part of their solutions, and are increasingly looking to video solutions to deliver new business models and capabilities.  Delivering media solutions within existing infrastructure constraints can be very costly.  This session will demonstrate how to leverage Azure Media Services for solutions ranging from health and human resources to manufacturing to retail.
